# ## Logistic Regression 
# 
# 
# ### What is Logistic Regression?
# Logistic Regression is a statistical machine learning algorithm used to model the probability of a binary or categorical dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome by estimating the parameters of a logistic function.
# 
# Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability of a binary outcome, such as whether a customer will buy a product or not, or whether an email is spam or not. The output of the logistic regression model is a probability value between 0 and 1, which can be converted to a binary class by setting a threshold.
# 
# Logistic Regression has many applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing. It is widely used for predicting the probability of a disease, credit risk, or customer churn, among other things.
# 
# ### Dependencies
# The implementation of Logistic Regression in this repository requires the following dependencies:
# 
# Python 3
# NumPy
# Pandas
# Scikit-learn
# 
# ### Usage
# To use the Logistic Regression implementation provided in this repository, follow these steps:
# 
# Install the required dependencies.
# Clone or download this repository.
# Open a terminal or command prompt in the downloaded directory.
# Run the logistic_regression.py script using the command python logistic_regression.py.
# Follow the prompts to provide input data and specify the parameters of the model.
# The script will output the accuracy of the model and the predicted probabilities for the input data.
# 
# ### Assumptions and Limitations
# Logistic Regression makes several assumptions about the data, including the linearity of the log-odds and the independence of the observations. It is also sensitive to outliers and the need for large sample sizes.
# 
# While Logistic Regression is a powerful and interpretable algorithm that can provide valuable insights into the relationships between variables, it may not be suitable for all use cases. It is important to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of the algorithm before using it for a particular problem.
