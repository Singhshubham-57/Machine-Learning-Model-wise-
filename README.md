# Machine-Learning-Model-wise-
This contains model wise hands on of every machine learning algorithm 
This repository contains a collection of machine learning models, each implemented in a separate directory. This README provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to use the models.

# Overview
The repository contains the following directories, each containing a separate machine learning model:

**linear_regression: Implementation of Linear Regression model.**

**logistic_regression: Implementation of Logistic Regression model.**

**decision_tree: Implementation of Decision Tree model.**

**random_forest: Implementation of Random Forest model.**

**Navie Bayes: Implementation of Neural Navie Bayes.**

Each model directory contains the implementation of the model in a Python script, as well as any necessary data files and additional scripts.

# Dependencies
The implementation of each model may have different dependencies. Please refer to the README file in each model directory for specific dependencies.

# Usage
To use the machine learning models provided in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository.
Navigate to the directory of the desired model.
Install any required dependencies (see the README file for specific instructions).
Run the Python script to train the model on your data or to make predictions on new data.
