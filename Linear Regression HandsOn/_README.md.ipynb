    "This is a simple implementation of Linear Regression algorithm in Python. Linear regression is a machine learning technique used to predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. In this implementation, we are using the ordinary least squares method to calculate the coefficients of the linear regression equation."

    "Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm used to predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and tries to find the best line or hyperplane that fits the data points to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is simple, widely used, and provides insights into the relationships between variables. However, it has some limitations, including sensitivity to outliers and the need for independent variables that are not highly correlated."
