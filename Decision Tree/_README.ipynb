    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "This README provides an overview of Decision Tree and instructions on how to use the implementation provided in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "A Decision Tree is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that creates a model in the form of a tree structure. The tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data into smaller subsets based on the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a Decision Tree is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on the value of one of the input variables, and each leaf node represents a predicted value for the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are commonly used in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, where the goal is to make predictions based on a set of input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "The implementation of Decision Tree in this repository requires the following dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3\n",
    "NumPy\n",
    "Pandas\n",
    "Scikit-learn\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the Decision Tree implementation provided in this repository, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required dependencies.\n",
    "Clone or download this repository.\n",
    "Open a terminal or command prompt in the downloaded directory.\n",
    "Navigate to the decision_tree directory.\n",
    "Run the decision_tree.py script using the command python decision_tree.py.\n",
    "Follow the prompts to provide input data and specify the parameters of the model.\n",
    "The script will output the accuracy of the model and the predicted values for the input data.\n",
    "## Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "Decision Trees make several assumptions about the data, including the independence of the observations and the absence of missing data. They are also sensitive to outliers and the need for large sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Decision Trees are a powerful and interpretable algorithm that can provide valuable insights into the relationships between variables, they may not be suitable for all use cases. It is important to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of the algorithm before using it for a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## License\n",
